# API Assignment Flutter Application

This project is a Flutter application that retrieves and displays data from a public API. The app consists of three main views:

1. **Users List View**: Displays a list of users fetched from the API.
2. **Photos View**: Displays the first 10 photos fetched from the API.
3. **Posts View**: Displays posts filtered by `userId == 1` fetched from the API.

## Features

- **Bloc State Management**: Uses Flutter's Bloc pattern to manage states across the app.
- **API Integration**: Fetches data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/` API.
- **Three Views**:
  - Users List: Shows all users.
  - Photos List: Shows the first 10 photos.
  - Posts List: Shows posts only for `userId == 1`.
