## Design Philosophy

- **OOP & Clean Code:** Built using Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure a maintainable and scalable codebase. Clean Code practices are followed to make the code easy to read, understand, and extend. The code structure is organized by having multiple layers for managing data, and network calls to ensure ease of scalability.
- **State Management** Flutter-bloc was used to manage on-screen updates and alert pop-ups.
- **Network Images** A third party-library was used to handle image caching, placeholder widgets, and error cases.
- **Data Filtering** Filtering and pagination was performed using URL query parameters.
